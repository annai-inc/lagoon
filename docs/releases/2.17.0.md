## Upgrades

There are no required actions or considerations with this release. As always, we suggest upgrading all minor versions.

## Deprecations

### activestandby task image
* This release introduces a new active/standby task image that does not require the use of the [dioscuri controller](https://github.com/amazeeio/dioscuri). Dioscuri is deprecated and will eventually be removed from the `lagoon-remote` helm chart. If you use active/standby functionality in your clusters, you should upgrade to lagoon v2.17.0 and update your remote clusters to the version of the `lagoon-remote` helm chart the v2.17.0 release says to use (see release notes for v2.17.0)
### API Harbor support
* Support for Harbor in the API will be removed in a future release. If you currently have your core installation with Harbor support, you should move to using the integration within lagoon-remote instead. See the documentation [here](https://docs.lagoon.sh/installing-lagoon/install-lagoon-remote) and read the section about Harbor.
* Removed in [v2.20.0](https://docs.lagoon.sh/releases/2.20.0)
### Harbor 2.1 and earlier support
* Support for Harbor 2.1.x (chart version 1.5.x) and older in `lagoon-remote` will be removed in a future release. You should consider upgrading Harbor to a newer version (currently Lagoon supports up to v2.9.x (chart version 1.13.x)), following any recommended upgrade paths from Harbor.
